Instructions:
Adjust the existing Python code to run without errors and align to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
 
Task:
Create a solution that accepts any three integer inputs representing the base (b1, b2) and height (h) measurements of a trapezoid in meters. Output the exact area of the trapezoid in square meters as a float value. The exact area of a trapezoid can be calculated by finding the average of the two base measurements, then multiplying by the height measurement.
Trapezoid Area Formula:
A = [(b1 + b2) / 2] * h
The solution output should be in the format
Trapezoid area: area_value square meters
 
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is
3
4
5
then the expected output is
Trapezoid area: 17.5 square meters
Alternatively, if the input is
3
5
7
then the expected output is
Trapezoid area: 28.0 square meters
