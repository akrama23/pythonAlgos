Instructions:
Create a Python solution to the following task. Ensure that the solution produces output in exactly the same format shown in the sample(s) below, including capitalization and whitespace.
 
Task:
Create a solution that accepts five integer inputs. Output the sum of the five inputs three times, converting the inputs to the requested data type prior to finding the sum.
First output: sum of five inputs maintained as integer values
Second output: sum of five inputs converted to float values
Third output: sum of five inputs converted to string values (concatenate)
The solution output should be in the format
Integer: integer_sum_value Float: float_sum_value String: string_sum_value
 
Sample Input/Output:
If the input is
1
3
6
2
7
then the expected output is
Integer: 19
Float: 19.0
String: 13627
