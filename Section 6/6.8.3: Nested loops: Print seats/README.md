Given num_rows and num_cols, print a list of all seats in a theater. Rows are numbered, columns lettered, as in 1A or 3E. Print a space after each seat.

Sample output with inputs: 2 3
1A 1B 1C 2A 2B 2C 


```

num_rows = int(input())
num_cols = int(input())

Note 1: You will need to declare more variables
Note 2: Place end=' ' at the end of your print statement to separate seats by spaces


    
    
''' Your solution goes here '''
    
print()


```
